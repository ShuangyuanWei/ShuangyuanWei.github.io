I'm a PhD candidate in quantitative marketing at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. I currently work on developing targeted interventions leveraging heterogeneous treatment effects in the context of sustainable behaviors and customer retention. 

Before starting my journey to become an academic researcher, I have studied and worked in the U.S. for 14 years. I moved to Washington DC from Beijing to obtain a masters degree in Economics. After graduation, I first worked in an economic consulting company where I created analyses for large-scale antitrust litigations. Then, I moved to Seattle to work for Amazon/AWS where I used data science techniques to improve business decision-making with data. 

As a seasoned data scientist, I've had extensive experience using various empirical techniques, including field experiments, causal machine learning, and quasi-experimental methods, to solve complicated business problems. During my PhD training, I have been deepening my understanding of the methods I previously applied at work, meanwhile I continue to learn new methods in econometrics and computer science, such as natural language processing (LLM) and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, I am enhancing my theoretical foundation in Microeconomic and Behavioral Economic theory. My goal is to publish high-quality research papers with managerial and societal relevance. 

I travel regularly between the Netherlands and USA. Outside of research, I enjoy boudlering(both in the gym and on the rocks outdoor), snowboarding, and running.
